## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Checking 20th Century or not

## AIM  
To write a Python program to check whether the entered year is 20th century or not using if..else statement.
## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Accept an integer input from the user representing a year.
3. Check whether the year lies between 1900 and 1999 (inclusive).
4. If true, display "Year is 20th Century."
5. Otherwise, display "Year is NOT 20th Century."
6. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212222060204
# Name-RUPESH J
# Write your code here

a=int(input())
if(a>=1900):
    print("Year is 20th Century.")
else:
    print("Year is NOT 20th Century.")
```

## RESULT
Thus, the implementation of Python programming to check whether the entered year is 20th century or not using if..else statement was verified successfully.
