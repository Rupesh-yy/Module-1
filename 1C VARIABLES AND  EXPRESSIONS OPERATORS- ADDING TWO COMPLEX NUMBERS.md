# Experiment No: 3-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Evaluate Expression Using eval() in Python

## AIM
To write a Python program to evaluate the expression a + b * c - a / b, and get the user input using the eval() function.

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Use the eval() function to get the values of a,b, and c as input from the user.
3. Print the values entered by the user.
4. Perform the calculation of the expression x=a+b*c-a/b.
5. Print the result of the expression.
6. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212222060204
#Name-RUPESH J
#Write your code here
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
x=a+b*c-a/b
print(x)
```
